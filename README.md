# Task 5. React. Building Dynamic User Interfaces

- This is the fifth task for the DataArt JS School. 

- It contains the HTML, CSS, TypeScript with React.js of a timeline based webpage.

- Here we use TypeScript with React and bootstrap with Vite.

## How to Use

- This is bootstrapped using Vite (React + TypeScript template). 
- Clone the repository (git clone https://github.com/mdmohiuddin32/DataArt-JS-School/tree/task-5).
- Then run the following commands in your terminal:
```console
  npm install
  npm run dev
```

The server should be accessible at http://localhost:5173

## Details

- The structure is made using Semantic HTML for better accessibility.
- We've added required CSS as given in the sample design.
- This task should contain almost all the required HTML, CSS, TypeScript with React necessary.
- We've initialized React in strict mode and have all the same functionality as our previous version of TypeScript.
- It also contains modularity.
- The React code fetches and parses the events.json file to get the data and dynamically display it.
- The added React code also supports the opening and closing of a modal.
- There could be future changes made as the project requires (for dark mode support, libraries, other functionality etc).
