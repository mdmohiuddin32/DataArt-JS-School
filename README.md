# Task 2. CSS and Preprocessors

- This is the second task for the DataArt JS School. 

- It contains the HTML structure and styles using CSS of a timeline based webpage.

## Details

- The structure is made using Semantic HTML for better accessibility.
- We've added placeholder HTML for the timeline to style for with the CSS.
- This task should contain almost all the required HTML and CSS necessary.
- There could be future changes made as the project requires (for dark mode support, javascript, etc).
