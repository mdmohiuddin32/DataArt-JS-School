# Task 4. Typescript. Fundamentals

- This is the third task for the DataArt JS School. 

- It contains the HTML, CSS and the TypeScript of a timeline based webpage.

- Here we use TypeScript to compile to JavaScript.

## Details

- The structure is made using Semantic HTML for better accessibility.
- We've added required CSS as given in the sample design.
- This task should contain almost all the required HTML, CSS and TypeScript necessary.
- We've initialized TypeScript in strict mode and have all the same functionality as our previous version of JavaScript.
- It also contains modularity.
- The TypeScript fetches and parses the events.json file to get the data and dynamically display it.
- The added TypeScript also supports the opening and closing of a modal.
- There could be future changes made as the project requires (for dark mode support, libraries, other functionality etc).
